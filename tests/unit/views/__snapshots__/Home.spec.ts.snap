      About the website
    </h2>
    <p>
       This is my final project for the ISDI Coders fulltime software development bootcamp, I hope to show everything I've learned and that it doesn't just work in my computer. It's an app that registers users and offers them boards to store different sorts of data in form of post-its. The name ireNotion was born in the imagination of Pia Borges, there is no copyright claim because neither of us believes in it.

    <h2>
      Technologies I've used
    </h2>
    <p>
       It's a Full Stack development project written with Typescript. The Frontend it's a VUE SPA. In the Backend I've used the framework Express to make a REST API to store the users information and their data. Everything is tested with Jest and Cypress.

    <p>
       I thank all of my teachers and classmates for everything I've learned and experienced during the bootcamp. I've had the time of my life while suffering like never before. I also thank my mother for supporting me, I couldn't have done it without her.
